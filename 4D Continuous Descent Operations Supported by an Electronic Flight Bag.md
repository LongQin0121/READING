A. TEMO Implementation
For the experiment presented in this paper, an initial 4D
trajectory is planned in cruise, well before reaching TOD. It
should be noted that besides an optimal 4D trajectory, the
planning algorithm also computes the right locations where
flaps/slats and landing gear shall be deployed. The objective of
TEMO is to achieve high accurate and predictable 4D
trajectories and therefore it is important to ask the pilot to use
these hyper-lift devices and landing gear at the right moment
(since they have a considerable impact in aircraft Drag
affecting time and/or vertical trajectory adherence).
